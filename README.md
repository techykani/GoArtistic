instructions & tasks billpz

**Instructions**

- you'll want to test it through ngrok
- so that billplz can call the callback. im not actually sure if the callback is getting called or working.
- you'll want to add some console.logs in it to see if its doing anything
- but the billplz flow works, and gets to the billing success page which is a 404 right now haha

**Instructions Two**

- i just threw in hubspot code too
- you'll need to set HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN
- not sure if im using the right id we get back from hubspot, when sending it to hmi backend

## TODO

- Type checking at search and autocomplete ( possiblly because of version changes and types )
